## Key Takewaways 

Making this game was passionate project of mine, however it was rushed and therefore has many technical debts that I would like to keep working on

1. Use better semantic HTMLs
2. API key should NOT be in tsx files, but .env
3. Remember to implement better accessibility
4. Responsiveness should be better, it is why the app doesnt work on mobile
5. Components could perhaps be split into smaller chunks
6. CSS practices are as good as I want it to be
